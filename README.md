# DriverPass-Project

In this project we were assigned by our client Liam, the owner of DriverPass, to make a system. This system needed to be cloud-based, allow for offline log downloads, allow customers to make reservations, take online tests, and attend online classes.

I believe what I did particularly well in this project is the reservation creation process for the end user. It allows for customers to choose their date, time, location of pickup, and if either is unavailible is allows for the user to choose another option. 

One thing I would like to revise in my documents is the "limitations" category. I believe there are many limitations I forgot to include for a system of this nature. The fact that it is constantly needing to be checked for needed updates, the offline use, and that it is cloud-based can cause some limitations.

My technique for designing software is really paying attention to what the client is wanting and expecting. Meeting every requirement while still allowing a system to run efficiently, smoothly, and correctly is my ultimate goal. Some techniques for the furture is using a team to get new ideas of the best way to make a different system and ensuring I am doing the best possible for my client.
